      Understanding The Problem

        As most know, the ongoing rise of hate crimes against Asians has increased since the beginning and outburst of COVID-19. Asian communities have been targeted and feared for their lives more than ever before in the last year or so. Trailing back to when the virus has reached the news, it has been said that it originated in bats in China spreading and transmitting worldwide into what is now a pandemic.  <br><br>

There have been correlations to rising violence and incidents against Asians, with words said by former U.S. President Donald Trump and other leaders. Trump referred to the Coronavirus as the “Chinese Virus,” which helped ignite the flame of racism that was already there. Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric around the virus sparked anti-Racism incidents, where he sought to shift blame for his lack of handling of the country which resulted in high rises of cases and deaths in the United States. He and other politicians put the target on Asians and people of Asian descent with statements and media reports of derogatory language. <br><br>

Reports are shown that racism against Asians in the United States have long been present, as explained in Harvard’s Bill of Health article titled “The Two Pandemics Facing Asian Americans: COVID-19 and Xenophobia,” stating  “Since the beginning of the pandemic, Trump and other officials have kindled flames of anti-Asian sentiment by referring to COVID-19 as the “China Virus” and “Wuhan Virus.” “...many Asian Americans were already starting to face discrimination, from people avoiding them in grocery store aisles to more violent hate crimes. This was due to the mistaken belief that they were somehow more likely to be infected because the first known COVID-19 cases were in China….Xenophobia is not limited to infectious disease outbreaks, either. After the September 11th attacks, violence and threats against Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, Sikh Americans, South Asian Americans and others perceived to be of Middle Eastern origin followed” (“The Two Pandemics Facing Asian Americans: COVID-19 and Xenophobia”). <br><br>
The virus outbreak was just a wake-up call on how divided this nation has become with violence and hate crimes against the AAPI communities leading back before the pandemic, as Asian Americans were already considered a high-risk group as there has long been a lack of knowledge of historic racism against Asian Americans. Xenophobia in history has already been present in numerous pandemics and emergencies, targeting racial and ethnic minorities.
